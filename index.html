	<h2><strong>My 'Hood</strong></h2>
	<p>So here we have a nice little webpage about my neighborhood. Countless people have died
	here for utterly no reason whatsoever and it doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon. But
	that's cool. Because it's still relatively cheap to live here, what with all the corpses and such, so I highly recommend buying a rundown shack of a home, here, as soon as you can.</p>

		<h2><strong>The Sites. The Sounds.</strong></h2>
		<p>Most of the sites and sounds are crime or random debris falling from some of our larger buildings at any given point (One of them is three stories tall!). Patterson Park butts right up against our west end and is basically just a cauldron of fire and heroin at all times :D. You can see one of our many pawn shops at any given time or maybe pop down to the brothel that is in place where our library once stood.</p>

		Just kidding guys, my neighborhood is amazing, it birthed me for christ's sake. If I had my way I would just slice it right out of Baltimore and deposit it into the ocean at my earliest convenience. Go Highlandtown Go!
